Acknowledgements

  I have to say a big thank to my company, <Asemantics> that allowed me working
  on this project, and all the <Ip Info DB> team for their interest.

  This work is dedicated to my city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
  earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
  because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:06 am.
  We'll never forget that episode.
